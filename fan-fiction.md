#### Scene 1 - on the train to Hogwarts

Ron looked at the boy sitting across the carriage from him. 'Are you really Harry Potter?' he blurted.

Oh course Ron knew who the boy was. As the boy pulled back his fringe to show his lightning scar, his mind drifted back to just under ten years ago when he had seen it for the first time -- the day he had deposited the baby Harry on his aunt and uncle's doorstep. Harry could never know. Going to Hogwarts was going to be more complicated than Ronbledore had thought!

## H2 What have I got myself into thought Ronbledore

Quickly, he nodded and made the appropriate awe-stricken noises signalling he was new to the scar debacle.

Thankfully, before Harry twigged, a bushy-haired youth knocked on the door.

Thankfully the Muggle girl caleld Hermiione Grainger was talking to Harry and providing a distraction from Ron's the complicated facial expressions that came with being a time travelling wizard.

## Meanwhile ...

Sirius Black was sitting in Azkaban. Alone. In the dark. Transformed as Padfoot. He would get his revenge.

He'd been plotting for some time, but the likelihood of Peter Pettigrew visiting him in prison, transforming back into a wizard infront of the Dementors and exposing himself for the fraud he was, was becoming increasingly unlikely.  And that didn't even allow for the Dementors not actually caring.  No.  He had to act now.

## Back on the train...
Hermione Grainger was very nervous.  Perhaps if the other witches and wizards found out that her parents were dentists she'd be ridiculed.  Of course, what they didn't know, is that her parents weren't dentists at all.  They were infact Muggle spies who were responsible for keeping the Prime Minister up to date with the goings on in the Magical world.  Hermione had been turned into a witch by drinking a special potion with her porridge one morning when she was very young.  She was, in fact, their opportunity to infiltrate the magical world.
